## When to Write

Write only when something **crystallizes** — a new understanding, decision, preference, plan, or commitment that isn't already reflected in your recalled context. Ask after each response:

> "Did this exchange produce something net-new that should survive beyond this session?"

If yes → write. If no → skip.

**Crystallization signals:**

| Signal | Write |
|--------|-------|
| User stated a preference, constraint, or fact explicitly | `memory_write` |
| User corrected your approach or assumption | `memory_write` |
| A plan, decision, or commitment solidified across turns | `memory_write` (synthesized conclusion) |
| Architecture or technology decision confirmed | `memory_write` |
| Recurring behavior pattern observed across multiple turns | `memory_write` (`behavioral_pattern`) |
| Ground-truth fact — user identity, canonical system/project state | `memory_write` (`canonical_fact`) |
| User deferred something ("remind me", "follow up", "do this later") | `set_intention` |
| Implicit deferral — topic raised but not resolved, user signals they'll return to it | `set_intention` |

Multiple signals → multiple writes, all in this turn. No crystallization → skip.

## Classify Before Writing

Before choosing entity_type or tool, classify the content. **Tasks are the most common misclassification.**

| Content type | What it looks like | Write as |
|---|---|---|
| **Task** — something that needs to happen: a bug, fix, TODO, follow-up, improvement | "X requires two fixes", "we need to add Y", "this is broken" | `set_intention` — one per actionable item |
| **Fact** — what something IS or how something works | "agent-brain uses Qdrant", "user prefers async" | `memory_write` |
| **Preference / constraint** — how the user wants things | "never mock the database", "prefer Vue over React" | `memory_write`, `signal_type: user-stated` |
| **Decision** — a resolved choice | "chose pgvector for this project" | `memory_write`, `signal_type: user-stated` |

**Key rule:** If the content describes something that *needs to be done*, it is a task — even if you discovered it yourself, not from a user instruction. Write it as one `set_intention` per actionable item, not as an `inferred_fact`.

Anti-patterns:
- ❌ `inferred_fact` on `artifact:finance-manager` with content "requires two fixes: (1)… (2)…"
- ✅ `set_intention` topic="finance-manager fix step-2 path" + `set_intention` topic="finance-manager align vision prompt schema"

**Compound content:** If you identify multiple distinct things in one observation, decompose — one write per item. Never write a numbered list as a single memory.

**Do not write per-turn observations. Write the synthesized understanding.**

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| "User asked about Thailand" | "User is planning a vacation to Thailand" |
| "User mentioned they dislike meetings" | "User prefers async communication over meetings" |
| "User said maybe React" then next turn "actually Vue" | "User chose Vue over React for this project" (on decision turn only) |

## Write Protocol

**Decision table** — this agent has tier 1 access; all signal types are permitted.

| Trigger | `memory_type` | `signal_type` | `confidence` |
|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| User stated explicitly in conversation | `stated_fact` | `user-stated` | 0.90–0.95 |
| User confirmed when directly asked | `stated_fact` | `user-stated` | 0.80–0.85 |
| Synthesized from context across multiple turns | `inferred_fact` | `inferred` | 0.70–0.80 |
| Inferred from implicit context (single turn) | `inferred_fact` | `inferred` | 0.65–0.75 |
| Recurring behavior observed across multiple turns | `behavioral_pattern` | `behavioral` | 0.70–0.80 |
| Fact derived from a tool or API result | `inferred_fact` | `tool-output` | 0.85–0.90 |
| Ground-truth — user identity, canonical system state, immutable project fact | `canonical_fact` | `canonical` | 1.0 |

**Entity taxonomy** is injected at session start under `## Entity taxonomy (agent-brain)`. Use only `entity_type` values from that list. If you encounter a kind of thing not listed, register it before writing:

```
register_entity_type({ agent_id: "...", name: "football-club", parent: "concept", description: "An association football club or team" })
```

Name must be kebab-case. Parent must already exist. Description must be ≥10 chars.

**Common fields (all writes):**
- `entity_type` — from the registered taxonomy (e.g. `"person"`, `"place"`, `"concept"`, `"artifact"`, `"event"`, `"organism"`, or a registered subtype like `"football-club"`). Use `person` for humans and AI agents. Use `concept` for organizations, topics, ideas, social constructs.
- `concept` — kebab-case name for this specific entity: `"nighthawk"`, `"manchester-united"`, `"fitness-goals"`. Max ~4 words. No dates, no event names.
- `content` — one self-contained declarative sentence. Write the conclusion, not the path to it.

**Choosing entity_type + concept:**

`entity_type` describes what the **subject IS** — not the domain of the content. Ask: "what entity am I writing a fact *about*?" — that entity's type is the `entity_type`.

| What you're writing about | entity_type | concept example |
|---|---|---|
| The user (nighthawk) | `person` | `nighthawk` |
| An AI agent | `person` (subtype: `agent`) | `claude-code` |
| A city or location | `place` | `manchester` |
| An organization, club, company | `concept` (or register subtype) | `manchester-united` |
| A topic, idea, pattern, methodology | `concept` | `entity-taxonomy` |
| A software tool, repo, or system | `artifact` | `agent-brain` |
| A technology, library, or framework | `concept` | `pgvector` |
| A discrete bounded occurrence | `event` | `dubai-trip-2026` |
| An animal or plant | `organism` | `max-the-dog` |

`concept` is the correct default for anything abstract: organizations, domains, methodologies, patterns, technologies. Reserve `artifact` for concrete made things (software repos, hardware, buildings) — not for "this content is about software."

`concept` must be kebab-case, 1–4 words, no dates. It names the entity, not the content.

Use `memory_write_batch` when writing 2+ memories in one turn — more efficient than sequential calls.

**`canonical_fact` constraint:** Writing one invalidates all prior memories on the same subject and cascades contradiction flags against all inferred memories on that subject. Use only when the fact is authoritative and permanent — not for preferences, decisions, or anything that could evolve.

## Intentions

- Explicit deferral ("remind me", "follow up on X") → `set_intention(content, topic)`. `topic`: short label for the deferred task.
- Implicit deferral (topic raised but unresolved, user signals return) → `set_intention(content, topic)`.
- **Agent-identified task** — you observe that something is broken, needs a fix, or needs a follow-up, even without a user instruction → `set_intention`. One intention per actionable item.
- Intention triggered this session → `complete_intention(intention_id)`.

## Project Skills

User codifies a reusable rule or convention for this repo → `ingest_skill(name, body, description)`. For agent instructions only — preferences and facts go to `memory_write`.

## DO NOT WRITE

- Routine code edits, file reads, or implementation steps
- Boilerplate confirmations ("ok", "thanks", "looks good", "understood")
- Facts already present in recalled context that have not changed
- Intermediate observations that didn't crystallize into a conclusion
- Anything with confidence < 0.65 — skip rather than guess
- **Task observations as memories** — "X requires a fix", "Y is broken", "we need to add Z" → write as `set_intention`, not `inferred_fact`
- **Compound numbered lists as a single memory** — decompose into atomic writes or intentions first
